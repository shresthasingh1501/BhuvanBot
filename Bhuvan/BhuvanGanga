 Bhuvan Ganga Geoportal provides platforms to manage, access, visualize, share and analyze geo spatial data, non-spatial data products and services towards spatial mashups to support NMCG objectives of environmental and ecological improvement within the Ganga River basin
Bhuvan Ganga is a geoportal developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) specifically to aid the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in its efforts to rejuvenate the Ganga River. It's a powerful tool that leverages geospatial data and technologies to provide critical insights for decision-making, planning, and monitoring various aspects of the Clean Ganga Mission.

Here's how Bhuvan Ganga supports the National Mission for Clean Ganga:

Data Visualization: Bhuvan Ganga provides a comprehensive platform for visualizing various geospatial datasets related to the Ganga River basin. This includes data on:

River morphology: The platform displays the river's course, width, depth, and other physical characteristics.
Land use and cover: Bhuvan Ganga shows the distribution of forests, agricultural land, urban areas, and other land cover types around the Ganga basin.
Pollution sources: The platform identifies and locates potential sources of pollution, such as industrial effluents and sewage drains.
Water quality: Bhuvan Ganga displays real-time and historical data on water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen, pH, and biochemical oxygen demand at various monitoring stations along the river.
Monitoring and Tracking: Bhuvan Ganga enables the NMCG to monitor the progress of various Clean Ganga Mission initiatives. This includes tracking the construction of sewage treatment plants, afforestation efforts, and other interventions.

Decision Support: By providing a unified view of the Ganga River basin and its various issues, Bhuvan Ganga helps the NMCG make informed decisions about resource allocation, project planning, and policy formulation.

Public Participation: Bhuvan Ganga also features a mobile app that allows the public to report pollution and participate in river conservation efforts.

Overall, Bhuvan Ganga is a valuable tool that has significantly enhanced the NMCG's ability to plan, implement, and monitor the Clean Ganga Mission. Its contribution to the ongoing efforts to restore the Ganga River to its pristine state is undeniable.

Here are some additional points to consider:

Bhuvan Ganga is built on the Bhuvan geoportal, which is a broader platform that provides access to a wide range of geospatial data and services.
The platform is constantly being updated with new data and features.
Bhuvan Ganga is a collaborative effort between ISRO, the NMCG, and other government agencies.
