The platform is used to monitor the progress of NABARD-funded watershed development projects across India.

Bhuvan NABARD provides a range of features that allow users to visualize and analyze watershed data. These features include:

Watershed boundary maps: The platform provides maps of all watersheds that have been funded by NABARD. These maps can be used to identify the location of watersheds, their boundaries, and their size.
Physical and financial progress: The platform tracks the physical and financial progress of each watershed project. This information can be used to assess the effectiveness of projects and identify areas where improvements are needed.
Interventions: The platform provides information on the interventions that have been implemented in each watershed project. This information can be used to understand how projects are designed to improve watershed management.
