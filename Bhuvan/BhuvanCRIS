Bhuvan, meaning "Earth" in Hindi, is an Indian geoportal developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It provides a platform for accessing and analyzing various geospatial data sets, including satellite imagery, topographic maps, and thematic layers related to environment, agriculture, water resources, etc.

CRIS, the Centralised Resource Inventory System, is a web-based application hosted on Bhuvan and developed by the MoEFCC. It serves as a centralized repository for environmental resource data collected from various sources across India. This includes information on forests, biodiversity, water resources, air quality, and other environmental parameters.

Together, Bhuvan and CRIS play a crucial role in supporting the MoEFCC's environmental management efforts. The system enables users to:

Visualize and analyze environmental data: CRIS data can be overlaid on Bhuvan's maps, allowing users to see spatial patterns and trends in environmental parameters.
Monitor environmental changes: CRIS tracks changes in deforestation, air and water quality, and other environmental indicators over time.
Make informed decisions: The data available through Bhuvan and CRIS can be used to inform environmental policies, planning, and resource management decisions.
