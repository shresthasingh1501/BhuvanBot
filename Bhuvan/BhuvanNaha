The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO, and the Maharashtra Water Resources Department (WRD) have initiated efforts for better utilization of information services through Bhuvan by active interaction, participation, and contribution.

Bhuvan is a web-based geoportal that provides access to a wide range of earth observation data and services. It is a valuable tool for water resources management, as it can be used to collect, analyze, and visualize data on a variety of water-related topics.

The Bhuvan Water Resources Management Support initiative in Maharashtra is focused on the following areas:

Capacity building: The NRSC is providing training and support to WRD staff in the use of Bhuvan for water resources management.
Data sharing: The NRSC is working with WRD to share water-related data sets, including satellite imagery, hydrological data, and ground water data.
Application development: The NRSC is working with WRD to develop new applications for Bhuvan that are tailored to the needs of water resources management in Maharashtra.
The Bhuvan Water Resources Management Support initiative is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water resources management in Maharashtra. It will help WRD to make better decisions about water allocation, water conservation, and water quality management.

Specific examples of how Bhuvan is being used for water resources management in Maharashtra include:

Irrigation management: Bhuvan is being used to monitor irrigation water deliveries, identify areas of water stress, and plan irrigation schedules.
Flood management: Bhuvan is being used to track floodwaters, identify areas at risk of flooding, and plan flood mitigation measures.
Groundwater management: Bhuvan is being used to assess groundwater resources, identify areas of overexploitation, and plan groundwater recharge measures.
The Bhuvan Water Resources Management Support initiative is a valuable partnership between the NRSC and WRD. It is helping to ensure that Maharashtra has the information and tools it needs to manage its water resources in a sustainable way.
