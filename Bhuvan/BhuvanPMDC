Website Content Details -
 Bhuvan PDMC is a website and smartphone app combination designed to facilitate the geo-tagging of assets created under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Per Drop More Crop (PMKSY-PDMC) scheme. This scheme focuses on improving water use efficiency in Indian agriculture through micro-irrigation systems, efficient water conveyance, and precision irrigation technologies.

Website (bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/pdmc):

Home: The central hub provides an overview of the portal, user login options (citizen or authorized officer), and access to important tools and resources.
Field Data Viewer: This interactive map interface allows users to:
Visualize assets: Filter and view the location of micro-irrigation structures (check dams, farm ponds, borewells, etc.) and other interventions undertaken under PDMC across India.
Map layers: Overlay various thematic layers like satellite imagery, administrative boundaries, water bodies, and infrastructure.
Details on hover: Clicking on an asset reveals its type, location coordinates, date of creation, implementing agency, and photos/info if available.
Download data: Export asset data in Excel format for further analysis.
Profile: Authorized officers can access their profile management and data submission section.
Dashboard: Offers summary statistics on the number of assets created, funding allocated, and scheme coverage across various states and districts.
Tools: Provides additional functionalities like measuring distances and areas, adding user-defined layers, and navigating the map.
Resources: A library of documents and manuals related to Bhuvan PDMC, user guidelines, and FAQs.
Discussion Forum: A platform for authorized officers to interact and discuss technical aspects of data collection and scheme implementation.
Mobile App (Bhuvan PDMC APK):
