Bhuvan Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) is a geospatial mapping initiative launched by the Ministry of Minority Affairs (MoMA) in 2023. The initiative aims to create a comprehensive geospatial map of all the physical assets created under the PMJVK scheme across India. This map will be accessible to the public through the Bhuvan portal, a geospatial platform developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

The geotagging of PMJVK assets will be carried out by field surveyors using the BhuvanPMJVK app. The app provides a user-friendly interface for entering data about the asset, such as its location, type, and status. Once the data is collected, it is sent to the Bhuvan server for processing.

The geotagging of PMJVK assets will have several benefits. First, it will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date record of all the physical assets created under the scheme. This information will be useful for monitoring the progress of the scheme and for assessing its impact on the socio-economic development of minority communities.

Second, the geotagging will make it easier for people to access the benefits of the PMJVK scheme. For example, people can use the Bhuvan map to find the nearest school, hospital, or skill development centre.

Third, the geotagging will help to promote transparency and accountability in the implementation of the PMJVK scheme. The public will be able to view the geospatial map of PMJVK assets and track the progress of the scheme.
