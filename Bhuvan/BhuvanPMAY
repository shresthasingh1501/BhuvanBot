Bhuvan PMAY is a web-based application developed by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It is a part of the Bhuvan geoportal, which provides access to a wide range of geospatial data and services.

Bhuvan PMAY provides a platform for tracking the progress of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), the Government of India's flagship housing scheme for the urban poor. The application allows users to view geo-tagged information about PMAY-funded housing projects, including the location of projects, the number of houses built or under construction, and the status of construction.

The application is available to the public through the Bhuvan website. To use the application, users must create an account and login. Once logged in, users can view information about PMAY projects by state, district, city, or project type.

The following are some of the features of Bhuvan PMAY:

Geo-tagged information: The application provides geo-tagged information about PMAY-funded housing projects. This information includes the location of projects, the number of houses built or under construction, and the status of construction.
Project status: The application allows users to view the status of PMAY projects. This information includes the project name, project location, project type, number of houses built or under construction, and the date of completion.
Reporting: The application allows users to generate reports on the progress of PMAY projects. These reports can be used to track the progress of the scheme and identify areas where improvement is needed.
Bhuvan PMAY is a valuable tool for tracking the progress of PMAY and ensuring that the scheme is implemented effectively. The application provides a wealth of information about PMAY projects, which can be used by policymakers, project implementers, and the public to monitor the progress of the scheme.

Public: The public can use Bhuvan PMAY to learn about PMAY-funded housing projects in their area. This information can be used to hold policymakers and project implementers accountable for the implementation of the scheme.
Bhuvan PMAY is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the transparency and accountability of PMAY. The application is a valuable resource for policymakers, project implementers, and the public, and it can help to ensure that the scheme is implemented effectively and that the needs of the urban poor are met.
